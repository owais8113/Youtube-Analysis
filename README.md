# Youtube-Analysis
I used the YouTube Data API V3 to extract key metrics such as video views, likes, dislikes, comments, and subscriber growth. The aim was to analyze how these metrics correlate with the performance and engagement of a YouTube channel over time. By applying data visualization techniques such as graphs and charts, I could identify patterns and trends, like which types of content perform best, the frequency of posting, and audience engagement levels.

This project helped me improve my skills in API integration, data extraction, and analytics, as well as generating meaningful visual insights from complex datasets. It’s a valuable tool for content creators or digital marketers to optimize their strategies for better channel performance. You can check the project

#Usage
Input the channel IDs you want to analyze in the script.
The data will be fetched from YouTube and saved in a structured format.
The script will generate visualizations and reports based on the extracted data.
Customize the analysis to focus on metrics of interest such as views, engagement rate, or subscriber growth.
Results
By analyzing the performance of multiple YouTube channels, we observed several insights:

Video Upload Frequency: Channels with a higher video upload frequency (e.g., FING) tend to have more consistent audience engagement and subscriber growth.
Content Strategy: FING’s strategy of focusing on trending topics leads to better audience engagement compared to other channels that may not focus on current trends.
Consistency: Channels that upload content consistently tend to retain and grow their audience over time, whereas channels with irregular uploads struggle to maintain engagement.
Storytelling & Presentation: FING’s unique approach to presenting topics in a hypothetical, storytelling manner resonates well with viewers, making the content more engaging.

#Future Work
We plan to expand this project by:

Integrating more metrics such as watch time and retention rates.
Adding a sentiment analysis feature to analyze comments.
Automating the process of generating visual reports for ease of use.
